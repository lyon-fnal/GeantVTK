This is the VTK visualization driver for Geant4. 
Put the VTK folder into source/visualization.

In source/visualization/CMakeLists.txt, add:
	add_subdirectory(VTK)

To build one of Geant's examples, modify the example's CMakeLists.txt with:
	find_package(ParaView)
	link_directories(<ParaViewBuildDir>/lib)
	target_link_libraries(exampleB1 G4visVTK ${Geant4_LIBRARIES})
    Also, in vis.mac, change one of the statements to "/vis/open G4VTK"
